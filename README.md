# Anharmonic_Score
Compute the anharmonic score of a material at finite temperature based on Carbogno et al., (2020) Phy.Rev.Materials. 

## File requirements:
Output files with ab-initio, harmonic, and anharmobic forces.
All the forces are given as norms in the different columns 

## Examples
Examples are given for Al at 300K and Zr at 100K,400K, and 800K.

## How to run
Change the "file_name" with the required file containing the forces
